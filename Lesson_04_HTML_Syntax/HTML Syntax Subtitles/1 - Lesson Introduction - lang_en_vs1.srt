2
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:07,180
I'm in the Santa Cruz mountains
in Northern California.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,900
And these are redwood trees.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,633
Redwoods are huge, unbelievably huge.

5
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:16,757
The ones behind me look like
they're about 50 meters tall,

6
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,148
it's kind of hard to tell.

7
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:22,130
But the biggest in the world
is 115 meters tall.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,406
That's 380 feet.

9
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:28,440
As I said,
these trees are absolutely enormous.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,040
I want you to remember this scene, and
especially the shape of these trees.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,970
We'll be coming back here later on.

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,700
Trees are going to be a recurring theme
throughout your web development career.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,310
In fact, at times, it may even feel
like your life revolves around them.

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,112
Anyway, think it's time to
start diving into some code.

15
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:48,490
I'm going to start by showing
you the basics of HTML.

16
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:51,360
You'll be writing code at first
inside the Udacity classroom, but

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,390
later on in the lesson you'll be using
a text editor specially made for code.

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,630
All right, lets get started.
